# Delhi-Metro

Data structures elements used in basic Algorithm :

1) Graphs: The shortest distance between two stations is calculated with the
help of graphs. Graph provides us nodes that can symbolize a single stations .Using
graphs , the complexity can be reduced efficiently.
2) File handling :The map showing the stations all across the city can be
entered and stored for further use using file handling. 3) Graphics*: The application can be visually shown using the graphics .
It gives the project a mature visual. 4) Vector: The entries can be stores in the vectors rather than using arrays
as the size of the entry of the graph is big and unknown .

Overview :

We have covered the following grounds under this project :
Shortest route: Describing the route ,the passenger will take to reach the
destination covering the shortest possible path. It is calculated using the
djikstra() function. 

Fare calculation :Depending upon the distance the he/she has travelled , the average fare will be charged according the rules laid down by DMRC
and is calculated using the money() function. 
Average time: The estimated time to reach the destination.
Stations in between : Stations which lie in between the path and train will
stop there is shown using the path() function. Average Distance : the expected average distance is calculated using the
minDistance() function. 
Change of lines: The user is also notified of the line he or she has to change and at
which station to reach the destination. 

Features Included :
It shows the
 Shortest Route between the stations
 Average fare
 Average time
 Average cost
 Average Distance
